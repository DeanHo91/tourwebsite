                            Da Nang is the largest city in central Vietnam and one of the countryâ€™s most important ports. It is located in the Midlands of Vietnam, from which Hanoi capital in the north and Ho Chi Minh city in the south are almost equally spaced. Da Nang is also the central point connecting three UNESCO World Heritage sites: Hue Citadel, Hoi An ancient town and My Son Sanctuary.

                        <p class="p1">
                            Da Nang has a rich history. It was once part of the Champa Kingdom, which ruled over central Vietnam from the 2nd to the 17th century.
